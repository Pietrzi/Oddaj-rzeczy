Project bootstrapped with create-react-app: run with npm start.

Project made with React and styled with SASS. Also used some Redux and simple react-scroll feature, simple form
validation, react pagination.

Idea of imaginary service where You can give away stuff that You don't need to children or homeless(any charity)
instead of throwing them out.

Mostly done, but the biggest feature multistep form is still in progress and some style corrections still needed.

Plan is to also use firebase authetification in feature and make it responsive.
